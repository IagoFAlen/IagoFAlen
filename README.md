<h1 align="left">Hi, I'm Iago 🇧🇷 — Developer and Lifelong Learner</h1>

<p>I work with systems involving neural networks, recommendation algorithms, data modeling, and web architecture. I'm especially interested in algorithm design, low-level implementations, and how systems behave internally — from memory management to scalable APIs.</p>

### 🤖 Machine Learning

I'm focused on understanding machine learning at a low level — from data representation to gradient descent. I study and implement core ML concepts to better control and optimize learning systems.

Topics of interest include:

- Neural networks with dynamic architecture  
- Backpropagation and gradient flow analysis  
- Sentence embeddings and semantic similarity (e.g., SBERT)  
- Recommendation systems combining structured and textual data  
- Low-level implementations in C and Python

### 🛡️ Pentesting & Security

I'm studying offensive security with a focus on network protocols, vulnerability exploitation, and system analysis. I enjoy understanding how systems fail and how to detect, prevent, and explore those failures from an ethical hacking perspective.

- Network enumeration and packet analysis  
- Exploit development and privilege escalation  
- Red Team labs and real-world attack simulation  
- Active learner at TryHackMe → [SirFAlen](https://tryhackme.com/p/SirFAlen)
